<h2>The Box Model</h2>
<p>
The box model is a very important concept in css. Every element on the page is contained in a rectangular box. In the case of inline elements, this box extends over the enclosed elements. For block elements, the box fills the width of the page by default. However, the size of the box can be set using the width and height rules in css.  Every box has a border, margins, and padding. The border is the outline of the box. The margin is space outside the border, seperating the element from other elements. The padding is space between the border and the box content. Setting the size of boxes, margins, and padding is important to achieve attractive page layout. It also can be tricky because content may overflow boxes, and the browser may adjust the layout to try to fit elements on the page.

The other file in this repository gives you a chance to practice using these concepts, as well as the css rules we practiced in our previous class. You should try to replicate the layout displayed in the screenshot provided. Refer to the rules described in chapter 14 to achieve the layout, and then use color, font-family and other rules you learned previously to match the other styling. To achieve the color-changing link effect, you will need to employ a pseudo-class, described in chapter 13.
